                <h1>How React works?</h1>
                <p>In most cases, React is written using JSX instead of standard JavaScript to simplify components and keep code clean.A React app usually has a single root DOM node. Rendering an element into the DOM will change the user interface of the page.Whenever a React component returns an element, the Virtual DOM will update the real DOM to match.</p>

                <h1>What are the differences between props and state ?</h1>
                <p>Props are known as properties it can be used to pass data from one component to another. Props cannot be modified, read-only, and Immutable.The state represents parts of an Application that can change. Each component can have its State. The state is Mutable and It is local to the component only.</p>

                <h1>Where useeffect is used beside Api data load?</h1>
                <p>he useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.

                    Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.</p>
